## Why Open Source
Snap has become such a massive project that it is hard for me to find time to work as fast as the community needs. 
By open sourcing my code the community can help in development and even draw from my code for their own projects.


## How can you contribute
You are welcome to fork the project make some edits and open a pull request, or just suggest an edit through the issues tracker.

## Minor Ideas
If you don't know how to code in Skript but you have an idea, please use the #ideas channel in our discord.

## Can you release the plugins or other server data
No, please don't ask for our plugins or Skript addons.

## Is everything here?
Pretty much, the only files ommited are our discord bot and our buycraft virtual currency because they contain private keys.

## Please Don't
Don't tell me part of the code is terrible. I am WELL aware. This collection took over a year in the making and I wasn't very good at Skript when it first started, so a lot of the code is either outdated, or using poor conventions, if you want to fix it for me be my guest.
